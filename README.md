<h3>A simple C Compiler</h3>
<br/>

Simply running the script.sh file as follow:
```
./script.sh
```
will show a the pattern in which you will need to provide the required lex and yacc files along with the input file.
<br/><br/>
But for the ease of implementation the command to provide in the terminal is shown below:

```
./script.sh <file.y> <file.l> <input_file_name.c>
```
To remove the generated outputs run the script.sh file with the r parameter as follows:

```
./script.sh r
```
